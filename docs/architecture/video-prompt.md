You are a software development project manager tasked with creating a detailed plan for a video generation refactoring project. Your goal is to analyze the given task description and create a comprehensive plan that addresses all aspects of the project. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and analyze the following task description:
<task_description>
<plan>
1. Project Objectives:
   - Integrate NPM Package editia-core for video generation feature
   - Share common types between mobile app and server primary without breaking existing code
   - Create typed request/response interfaces for front-end to back-end communication (inspired by tRPC pattern)
   - Establish architectural patterns for code organization and communication
   - Harmonize code validation, checks, and monetization strategy across systems
   - Implement comprehensive testing for shared types
   - Document the new architecture and video generation feature

2. Files to Analyze and Modify:
   - `/packages/editia-core/` - NPM package source files
   - `/mobile-app/src/types/` - Mobile app type definitions
   - `/server-primary/src/types/` - Server type definitions
   - `/mobile-app/src/services/video/` - Video generation service files
   - `/server-primary/src/controllers/video/` - Video generation endpoints
   - `/server-primary/src/routes/video/` - Video generation routes
   - `/mobile-app/src/api/video/` - Video API client code
   - `/shared/validation/` - Validation schemas
   - `/shared/monetization/` - Monetization strategy files
   - `package.json` files in relevant directories
   - Documentation files (`README.md`, API docs)
   - Test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)

3. Detailed Implementation Plan:

   **Phase 1: Analysis and Setup**
   a. Audit existing video generation code in mobile app and server
   b. Identify common types currently duplicated between front-end and back-end
   c. Analyze current editia-core NPM package structure and capabilities
   d. Document current communication patterns and pain points

   **Phase 2: editia-core Integration**
   a. Update editia-core package with video generation types
   b. Create shared interfaces for video generation requests/responses
   c. Define common enums, constants, and utility types
   d. Version and publish updated editia-core package
   e. Update package.json dependencies in mobile app and server

   **Phase 3: Type Sharing Implementation**
   a. Create `/packages/editia-core/src/video/types.ts` with shared types
   b. Define VideoGenerationRequest, VideoGenerationResponse interfaces
   c. Create error types and status enums
   d. Implement validation schemas using shared types
   e. Gradually replace duplicate types in mobile app and server

   **Phase 4: Communication Pattern Establishment**
   a. Design tRPC-inspired request/response pattern
   b. Create typed API client for mobile app
   c. Implement typed route handlers on server
   d. Define middleware for request validation
   e. Establish error handling patterns

   **Phase 5: Code Harmonization**
   a. Standardize validation logic using editia-core
   b. Unify error handling across mobile and server
   c. Harmonize monetization checks and business logic
   d. Refactor existing video generation endpoints
   e. Update mobile app to use new typed APIs

   **Phase 6: Testing Implementation**
   a. Create unit tests for shared types
   b. Implement integration tests for request/response flow
   c. Add validation tests for type safety
   d. Create end-to-end tests for video generation feature
   e. Set up CI/CD pipeline tests

   **Phase 7: Documentation**
   a. Document new architecture patterns
   b. Create API documentation for video generation endpoints
   c. Write migration guide for other features
   d. Document type sharing best practices
   e. Create troubleshooting guide

4. Points to Watch:
   - Ensure backward compatibility during gradual migration
   - Monitor for breaking changes in existing functionality
   - Maintain version compatibility between editia-core and consuming applications
   - Watch for circular dependencies when sharing types
   - Ensure proper error handling during the transition period
   - Monitor performance impact of new type validation
   - Be cautious with monetization logic changes to avoid revenue impact
   - Coordinate deployments between mobile app and server to avoid API mismatches

5. Potential Improvements:
   - Implement automatic code generation for API clients from shared types
   - Create developer tools for type validation and debugging
   - Establish automated testing for type compatibility across versions
   - Implement runtime type checking for enhanced reliability
   - Create code linting rules to enforce new architectural patterns
   - Develop migration scripts for future feature refactoring
   - Consider implementing OpenAPI/Swagger generation from shared types
   - Add performance monitoring for the new communication patterns

6. Timeline and Priorities:

   **Week 1-2: High Priority**
   - Complete analysis and setup (Phase 1)
   - Begin editia-core integration (Phase 2)

   **Week 3-4: High Priority**
   - Finish editia-core integration
   - Start type sharing implementation (Phase 3)

   **Week 5-6: Medium Priority**
   - Complete type sharing
   - Implement communication patterns (Phase 4)

   **Week 7-8: Medium Priority**
   - Code harmonization (Phase 5)
   - Begin testing implementation (Phase 6)

   **Week 9-10: Low Priority**
   - Complete testing
   - Documentation (Phase 7)
   - Final validation and deployment

   **Ongoing: Maintenance**
   - Monitor for issues
   - Gradual rollout to other features
   - Continuous improvement based on feedback
